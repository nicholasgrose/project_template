# Governance

This project is currently maintained by a single person with an open-source spirit.

All decisions on project direction, feature implementation, and pull request approvals rest with the sole maintainer.

This governance model is in place to ensure a clear and consistent direction for the project in its early stages.
As the community grows and interest in the project increases,
this policy may be updated to include additional maintainers or a formal team of collaborators.
