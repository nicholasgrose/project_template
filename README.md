# Nicholas's Project Template

## About

This is a repository to help me quickly start new projects.
If you like how it works, feel free to use it, though!

## Documentation

See the [doc site](https://nicholasgrose.github.io/project_template/) for the documentation!

## Making Changes

If you intend to download and change this template, I would recommend running `task bootstrap` after cloning.
This will create all the necessary virtual environments and install all the dependencies.

You can then use the CLI as described in the documentation.
