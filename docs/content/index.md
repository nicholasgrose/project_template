# Welcome to Palimpsest

This is a repository that stores my repo template.
This provides scripts to generate a new repo as well as to apply the template to an existing repo.

## Feature Overview

### Template Project

The template repo provides a number of useful features:

- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` with sensible defaults
- `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` files
- A pre-configured mkdocs skeleton site
- Platform-agnostic scripts for bootstrapping the repo and viewing the site locally
- A pre-configured CI to deploy the static mkdocs site
- Built-in run configurations for JetBrains IDEs

### Generation Script

The generation script provides the following features:

- Automatic bootstrapping of new repos by initializing Git and building virtual environments
- Template-based repo generation
